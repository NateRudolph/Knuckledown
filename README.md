Knuckledown
===========

Knuckledown is a to-do app designed to help you focus on one task at a time.  You provide a list of small tasks and the approximate time it will take to complete them. Then rather than showing you everything in one intimidating list, Knuckledown will present each in the order provided and kindly remind you of the time left to complete the task.
